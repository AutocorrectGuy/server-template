## 🚀 How to Set Up the Project on Your Local Machine

Follow these simple steps to get the Express server up and running with automatic browser launching using `nodemon`!

### 1. 📥 Clone or Download the Repository

- Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone` or download the ZIP file of the project.

### 2. 📦 Download and Install Node.js

- Download and install **Node.js** from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Make sure to install the **LTS** version for stability.

### 3. 🔧 Install Dependencies

- Open your code editor or terminal, navigate to the project directory using `cd` command:

  ```bash
  cd path/to/project-directory
  ```
- Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies, including `express` for the server and `nodemon for` automatic server restarts:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
### 4. 🖥️ Start the Development Server
- If you are on Windows, open the Command Prompt and run:
  ```bash
  start dev
  ```
- If you are NOT on windows, run
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
  and open http://localhost:3000/

### 5. 🎉 Ready to Go!
- Your Express server is now running! Any changes you make to the code will automatically restart the server and reload the browser. Enjoy coding! 😊
